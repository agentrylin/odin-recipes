        <p>A Yule log cake, a.k.a. a bûche de Noël, is a traditional holiday dessert that is meant to resemble an actual log. A sponge cake is baked in a Swiss roll pan, filled, rolled into a cylinder, then frosted again.

            The yule log tradition goes back centuries: Yule or Yuletide is a winter festival that was historically celebrated by people in Northern Europe. During the festival, a special log burnt on a hearth. Nobody quite knows where this custom comes from, but it's likely the inspiration behind the festive cake.</p>
